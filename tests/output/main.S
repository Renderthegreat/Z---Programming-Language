# Dear User,														#
# Thank you for using my compiler, it means a lot to  #
# me! This is an open source project from Renderlabs  #
# and since I made this compiler for you I give you	#
# one thing to consider: Please use this language	  #
# for open-source if possible. Remember, you make the #
# internet better for everyone by sharing!				#
